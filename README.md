This project covers almost the entire Power BI cycle, starting with data preprocessing â€” including connecting to data sources, cleaning, transforming, forecasting, and loading the data. It also involves data modeling, such as designing and implementing a data model, creating measures using DAX, and optimizing model performance. The final stage includes analyzing and visualizing the data by creating reports and dashboards, and sharing them with stakeholders.
